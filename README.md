# Faust-Alchemist
* Filters
* Oscillators
* Amplifiers

# Faust 
* I am working to build it on the arm cortex board
* I will do more dsp with it 

# C++
* I had salvaged all the codes I found
* Millions of codes 
* It was a big hassle to make it work
* When Faust already has it and can do it easy
* But I didn't know faust or how to use it the way I want to
* It is not like c++ and you can not do what you want to with it
* I was learning DSP theory though, so it was easier at that time to use it
* Now I have Octave,Python,Lua,and Faust
* If I disover how to make sense of the Scilab API I will use that too it has alot of good tutorials


# CoreDSP
* I have Carlo MKL/IPP and Kentucky Kfr
* That is the Casino DSP
* I think ne10 will be perfect too
* I have more dsp even than that by far
* I have all the DSP of the world
