# Faust-Alchemist
* Filters
* Oscillators
* Amplifiers

# Faust
* I plan to use faust
* I dont really like the functional programming
* I do not know how to do what I want to do in it
* It's not like C where you can anything you want to do
* You have to do it functionally 

# I plan to use it as algorithms
* Not at all to make plugins 
* As functions it works perfectly

# You can not call c++ from faust
* I do not think so
* The only way to call faust from c++ is to use the LLVM
* Or have faust generate c++ code
* In theory faust can optimize dsp much better than c++
* Faust isn't a general purpose language and is only for audio dsp samples
* A c++ compiler has to optimize for many general purpose things
* So faust could generate much more optimzied code because it is not a general purpose language like c++

# Faust LLVM
* I have the general code to run it
* I can use it in Lua, Octave, Python too
* You could use it in any language that can work with Swig
