# standard-faust
std::faust is c++ callable faust libraries and effects

# It works with the LLVM
* can generate the codes to call faust libraries
* can run any faust script you want
* it specifically to automatically generate faust library functions as callable audio in C++

# The generator is not finished
* Can only run faust scripts
* can also run polyphonic faust scripts

# FX Database
* sometime I will make the fx database
* Can query the fx you want and get the codes
* Can have a tiny prolog and use logic to find your fausts
