# Faust-Alchemist

# Mephisto.lv2
* Use the Faust LLVM as LV2

# FaustFX
* It is some rinky code to use Faust LLVM 

# Opcode synthesizer
* the experimental faust library
* It generates the opcodes for simple Faust audio stream

# You will not understand it now
* Later you will understand Machine Intelligence Theory of Dynamic Functional Vector Languages
* Faust, it is an artificial intelligence language but already convenientely has all the flangers you will want to have

# It is a theory of Machine Audio Intelligence
* No, the artificial intelligence is the faust language
* This is just a machine intelligence not human
* I will not pretend it is a human intelligence
* It will synthesize the audio with nuclear sharp precision though

# I will never take it to the machine audio intelligence level
* I am just being retarded about it
* When you see it you will say you know I never realized you can do that
* The simplest things are the things people cherish dearly or despise and detest with prejudice
